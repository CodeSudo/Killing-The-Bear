## 2013

### Sep

#### Watering Hole Attacks using Hello

In September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing page for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then redirected to a URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected.

### Jun

#### Watering Hole Attacks using Lightsout

In June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole attacks. They compromised a number of energy-related websites and injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer.
