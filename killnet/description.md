Killnet is a pro-Russian hacktivist group which started its activities in early 2022 as a DDoS and Botnet service.

When the Russian-Ukrainian war broke out, it started attacking Airport websites and other types of services via DDoS. From April 2022 onwards, it started attacking a wider range of critical infrastructures of NATO member countries or countries positioned towards Ukraine within the war.
