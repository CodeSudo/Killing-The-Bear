# Wordpress Javascript Injection

## Description

As outlined in the latest [hacked website report](https://sucuri.net/reports/2021-hacked-website-report/) from Sucuri team, They've been tracking a long-lasting campaign responsible for injecting malicious scripts into compromised WordPress websites. This campaign leverages known vulnerabilities in WordPress themes and plugins and has impacted an enormous number of websites over the year â€” for example, according to PublicWWW, the April wave for this campaign was responsible for [nearly 6,000 infected websites](https://publicwww.com/websites/%22legendarytable.com%22/) alone.

Since these PublicWWW results only show detections for simple script injections, we can assume that the scope is significantly larger.
