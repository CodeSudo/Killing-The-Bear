Dridex has also been delivered by Emotet since 2017. This suggests that there is a functional relationship between the two groups (they share resources).

## UNC1543

Evil Corp has almost exclusively obtained initial access to victims' networks from UNC1543.

In the months prior to the indictments, Mandiant [reported](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/head-fake-tackling-disruptive-ransomware-attacks) on FAKEUPDATES being used as the initial infection vector for DRIDEX infections that later resulted in the deployment of BITPAYMER or DOPPELPAYMER
