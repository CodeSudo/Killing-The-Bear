# Description

Dragonfly is a cyberespionage group that has been active since at least 2011. They initially targeted defense and aviation companies but shifted to focus on the energy sector in early 2013. They have also targeted companies related to industrial control systems.

According to Kaspersky, Crouching Yeti has been operating since at least 2010 and has infected roughly 2,800 targets in 38 countries, and in industries as diverse as education and pharmaceuticals.

A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as [Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0](https://apt.etda.or.th/cgi-bin/showcard.cgi?g=Berserk%20Bear%2C%20Dragonfly%202%2E0). There is debate over the extent of the overlap between Dragonfly and Dragonfly 2.0, but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups.
