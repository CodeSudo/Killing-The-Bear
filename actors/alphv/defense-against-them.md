# Defense against them

## Defense

* Review domain controllers, servers, workstations and active directories for new or unrecognized user accounts.
* Back up data regularly and password-protect backup copies offline.
* Use network segmentation.
* Require administrator credentials to install software.
* Establish a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of data and servers in a physically separate, segmented and secure location.
* Update and patch operating systems, software and firmware frequently.
* Utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA).
