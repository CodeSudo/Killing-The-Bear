{% hint style="warning" %}
The ALPHV group refuses to work with any English-speaking affiliates, prioritizing Russian speakers
{% endhint %}

Alphv has very similar TTPs to other prolific ransomware gangs and hash sought to recruit team members from:

* BlackMatter
* DarkSide
* [REvil](../revil/)

Note: Some cybercrime forum users have commented that ALPHV may even be an evolution or rebranding of [BlackMatter](https://www.varonis.com/blog/blackmatter-ransomware?hsLang=en), itself a ‘spin-off’ or successor of [REvil](https://www.varonis.com/blog/revil-msp-supply-chain-attack?hsLang=en) and [DarkSide](https://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware?hsLang=en).&#x20;
