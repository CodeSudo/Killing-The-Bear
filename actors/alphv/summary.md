# Summary

## Description

Is a ransomware variant and ransomware extortion group that first emerged around November 2021. The group operates under a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, where the original ransomware product is sold to affiliates in illicit underground hacking communities such as XSS and Exploit. ([Overtoperator](https://www.overtoperator.com/p/threat-actor-profile-alphv?s=r))

The threat actors leveraging BlackCat, often referred to as the 'BlackCat gang,' utilize numerous tactics that are becoming increasingly commonplace in the ransomware space. Notably, they use multiple extortion techniques in some cases, including the siphoning of victim data before ransomware deployment, threats to release data if the ransom is not paid and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
